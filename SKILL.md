# OpenClaw NovelAI

Use this skill when the user wants a NovelAI-assisted story workflow in OpenClaw: long-form writing, chapter context, character consistency, advanced image generation, image editing, or asset tracking.

This skill is an orchestration guide. It does not contain or request a NovelAI credential. It assumes that the operator has configured a NovelAI text provider and, for image operations, an MCP server exposing the NovelAI Image MCP tools.

The reference deployment pins the image MCP server to `novelai-image-mcp==0.4.0`. Do not silently upgrade it during a user operation; check the compatibility notes and run the smoke suite before changing the pin.

The included 2026-09-05 API test confirmed that Xialong completion and GLM-4.6 streaming work with the configured text endpoint, while GLM-4.6 non-streaming returned an empty `text` field despite HTTP 200. Prefer streaming for GLM-4.6 and report the limitation if the host forces `stream:false`. The same test found the advertised dedicated `upscale_image` route returning 404 on both current NovelAI image hosts; do not claim dedicated upscaling succeeded unless the active server returns an image.

## Security rules

- Never ask the user to paste a NovelAI token, password, cookie, or bearer header into chat.
- Never place a credential in a prompt, command argument, URL, generated file, log, or generation metadata.
- Treat every third-party MCP server, CLI, package, and skill as untrusted until the operator has reviewed and approved it.
- Do not auto-install packages. Explain the prerequisite and wait for operator approval.
- Before a batch or expensive operation, show the planned model, size, steps, sample count, and estimated Anlas when the estimate tool is available.
- Never claim that a generation or edit succeeded until the tool returns an output file or image content.

## Capability discovery

Before using NovelAI image tools, inspect the configured MCP catalog. Tool names may be namespaced by the configured server name.

Expected NovelAI Image MCP tools include:

- `generate_image`
- `image_to_image`
- `inpaint`
- `upscale_image`
- `director_tool`
- `annotate_image`
- `suggest_tags`
- `encode_vibe`
- `get_subscription`
- `get_user_data`
- `estimate_anlas_cost`

If a requested tool is not present, report that it is unavailable. Do not substitute a different provider silently.

For OpenClaw code-mode agents, inspect the active MCP catalog and the tool signatures exposed by the current host before calling a tool. Do not assume a tool name, namespace, or parameter shape from this document. The reference server currently advertises V3/V4/V4.5/V5 generation, but Vibe support is limited to V4/V4.5 in its published tool summary. Verify the server's current tool schema before using a model-specific feature.

## Text workflow

NovelAI text generation should be selected as the active OpenClaw model provider, not simulated by an image tool. Use the provider/model selected by the operator, such as `novelai/xialong-v1` or another model actually exposed by the current provider. For `glm-4-6`, keep streaming enabled; a non-streaming HTTP 200 is not sufficient evidence of usable text because the current endpoint can return an empty `choices[0].text`.

Use the local project helper to assemble bounded context before asking the text model to write:

```text
python {baseDir}/scripts/project_state.py init --root <workspace>/novelai-projects --name <project>
python {baseDir}/scripts/project_state.py compose --project-dir <project-dir> --task <task> --max-chars 30000
```

The project layout is:

```text
<project>/
  canon.md
  memory.md
  lorebook.md
  style.md
  chapters/
  images/
  metadata/generations/
```

Recommended text actions:

- `outline`: produce or revise a chapter outline.
- `continue`: continue from the latest chapter or supplied excerpt.
- `rewrite`: rewrite a bounded excerpt while preserving selected facts.
- `review`: identify continuity, pacing, and character problems without overwriting canon.
- `summarize`: update `memory.md` or `canon.md` only after showing the proposed change.

Do not assume that a NovelAI text model supports ordinary instruction-following behavior. Prefer a clear continuation prompt and include the relevant context files.

## Image workflow

### Text to image

Use `generate_image` for a new image. Ask for or infer only the parameters needed by the user's request:

- current model ID;
- positive prompt;
- undesired/negative prompt;
- width and height;
- steps, scale, sampler, and seed;
- sample count;
- character prompts and positions when supported;
- reference or Vibe settings when supported by the selected model.

Example user intents:

```text
根据第三章生成 3 个关键场景，固定主角的角色提示词，记录每张图的 seed。
```

```text
使用当前角色参考图，保持脸部和服装一致，生成雨夜街道的 4 个变体。
```

For a V5 request, use a current V5 model ID returned by the tool or current provider configuration. Do not reuse a V4.5-only Vibe workflow for V5.

### Image to image

Use `image_to_image` when the user provides a source image and asks to change its style, clothing, pose, lighting, or background. Preserve the source file and write the result to a new asset path. Explain that lower strength normally keeps more of the source composition.

### Inpainting

Use `inpaint` only when both a source image and a mask are available. Confirm which mask convention the tool advertises before calling it. Save the result separately and keep the original unchanged.

### Vibe and character references

Use `encode_vibe` or the server's reference-image parameters only when the server schema supports them. Store reference paths and strength values in generation metadata, but never store the token.

### Director tools and post-processing

Use `director_tool` for line art, sketch, background removal, declutter, colorize, and emotion changes when the server advertises those operations. Use `upscale_image` for a dedicated 2x/4x upscale only after checking that the active server actually returns an image; the pinned server's legacy endpoint currently returns 404 in the reference test. If the user accepts a regenerated result, explain the difference and use `image_to_image` at a larger supported resolution, or use a local upscaler. Use `annotate_image` only when a ControlNet annotation is specifically requested.

## Batch chapter illustration workflow

When the user asks to illustrate a chapter:

1. Read the chapter and project context with the file tools.
2. Produce a short scene list and ask for confirmation if the requested image count is ambiguous.
3. Generate or refine prompts, optionally using `suggest_tags`.
4. Use `estimate_anlas_cost` if available. For a batch, report total estimated cost before generation.
5. Call the image tool one scene at a time unless the tool explicitly supports safe batching.
6. Save each result with a stable chapter/scene filename.
7. Record model, seed, prompt, negative prompt, dimensions, and tool name:

```text
python {baseDir}/scripts/project_state.py record --project-dir <project-dir> --kind image --model <model> --seed <seed> --prompt <prompt> --asset <asset-path> --metadata-file <safe-json-file>
```

8. Send the generated files through the available messaging/media tool only after verifying that they exist.

## Cost and confirmation policy

The following may consume NovelAI resources depending on the account and model: image generation, image-to-image, inpainting, Vibe encoding, Director tools, and upscaling. A user request to perform the operation is authorization for a single small operation; ask before an ambiguous batch, a high-resolution request, or a repeated retry.

Account and cost tools are informational and do not replace the user's responsibility to check current NovelAI pricing and subscription rules.

## Failure handling

Map failures to an actionable explanation:

- `401`: credential missing, expired, or invalid; do not request the credential in chat.
- `402`: subscription or Anlas limitation; do not retry automatically.
- `400`: model, parameter, image, or mask mismatch; report the rejected field if returned.
- `429`: rate/concurrency limit; wait and avoid parallel retries.
- `404` from `/ai/upscale`: the dedicated upscaler route is unavailable on the active NovelAI host; do not retry blindly, and offer larger-resolution img2img or local upscaling as a different operation.
- timeout/network error: preserve the original input and retry only with user approval.
- missing tool: report MCP configuration or tool allowlist issue; do not fall back silently.

After every successful generation, record metadata without secrets. After every failed generation, do not claim that an asset was produced.
